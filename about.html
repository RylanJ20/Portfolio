          Hi! I'm Rylan, I am an aspiring product manager and freelance
          developer and I love to create new things like applications & games!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently a student at the University of Louisville (U of L)
          studying Computer Information Systems (CIS) with tracks in Business
          Process Management, Information Security, and Web Development. I am
          focused on product management because it sparks my interest the most.
          I also still do some development in my freetime I will graduate in May
          2022, and I am looking for work for the summer and beyond! I am
          currently located in Louisville, KY, but I am open and willing to
          relocate after graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been extremely interested in gaming for a long time. Ever since
          I can remember, me and my brothers would always play on the Xbox
          against each other and we were all super competitive. Whether it was
          sports games, FPS games, or even games like Minecraft. I joined the
          Esports club at U of L during my second year and played on the Rocket
          League team. I put a lot of time trying to improve and I've won over
          $500 in my time playing Rocket League.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, I enjoy developing games almost as much as I do playing
          them. After being introduced to game engines and developing games,
          whenever I play a game, I can only think about what it took to develop
          certain aspects of it. After playing and thinking like that, it makes
          me want to improve my game developing skills that much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really enjoy watching and talking about sports. Although I grew up
          playing and watching soccer for 16+ years, my favorite sports to watch
          are football and basketball. My favorite football team is the
          Minnesota Vikings and my favorite basketball team is the Phoenix Suns.
          Growing up in Kentucky, even though we have outstanding college
          basketball teams to root for, we don't have any professional sports
          teams support. Because of this I found my own teams to support and I
          ended up choosing the Suns and the Vikings for Basketball and Football
          respectively. I post a lot about sports on my
          <a href="https://twitter.com/rylanj20">Twitter</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, I was introduced to a lot of different music by my parents
          and brothers. My father listens to anything from Hip-Hop to Country,
          while my mother stays around punk-rock & pop. Personally, I listen to
          Hip-Hop and Pop the most because those are what I relate to the most.
          Some of my favorite artists are J. Cole, Mac Miller, and Kid Cudi. I
          am very passionate about music and I love talking about it with
          people! I also tweet about music on my
          <a href="https://twitter.com/rylanj20">Twitter</a>. You can also check
          out my
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/z4nryx?si=61f1dbf8e2e5487c"
            >Spotify</a
          >
          and see what I listen to and even look at some public playlists that I
          have!
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to a long career in product management where I can help
          people/companies take their products to a whole new level. My long
          term goal is to become a product manager for a major game company
          where I can work with game developers and help create fun games for
          people to play! I love to make ideas come to life and make online
          experiences more fun overall for everyone!
