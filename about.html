          Hi! I'm Rylan and I'm an IT Support Specialist with Twenty2
          Technologies LLC.
        </p>
        <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Louisville in 2022 with a BSBA in
          Computer Information Systems with tracks in Business Process
          Management, Information Security, and Web Development. I am currently
          located in the San Francisco Bay Area of California!
        </p>
        <p>
          My dream job is to work at a major gaming company. After being
          introduced to game engines and developing games, whenever I play a
          game, I can only think about what it took to develop certain aspects
          of it. After playing and thinking like that for a few years, it made
          me want to create my own games and be able to make important decisions
          on them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to a long career in tech where I can continue to learn
          as much as possible and helping a company however I can with the
          skills that I have now and that I will gain along the way. My long
          term goal is to have a high up role a major game company where I can
          work with game developers and help create fun games for people to
          play! I love to make ideas come to life and make online experiences
          more fun overall for everyone!
        </p>
        <h2>Casual Interests</h2>
        <p>
          I have been extremely interested in gaming for a long time. Ever since
          I can remember, my brothers and I would play Xbox with and against
          each other and we were always super competitive. Whether it was sports
          games, FPS games, or even sandbox games like Minecraft. I joined the
          Esports club at U of L during my second year and played on the Rocket
          League team. I put a lot of time trying to improve and learned a lot
          about the Esports community as a whole. Nowadays, I enjoy developing
          games almost as much as I do playing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really enjoy watching and talking about sports. Although I grew up
          playing and watching soccer for 16+ years, my favorite sports to watch
          are football and basketball. My favorite football team is the
          Minnesota Vikings and my favorite basketball team is the Phoenix Suns.
          Growing up in Kentucky, even though we have outstanding college
          basketball teams to root for, we don't have any professional sports
          teams support. Because of this I found my own teams to support and I
          ended up choosing the Suns and the Vikings for Basketball and Football
          respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, I was introduced to a lot of different music by my parents
          and brothers. My father listens to anything from Hip-Hop to Country,
          while my mother stays around punk-rock & pop. Personally, I listen to
          Hip-Hop and Pop the most because those are what I relate to the most.
          Some of my favorite artists are J. Cole, Mac Miller, and Kid Cudi. I
          am very passionate about music and I love talking about it with
          people!
